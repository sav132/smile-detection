## Camera Facial Detection and 4 Channel Image Overlay

A little script I cooked up detect face(s) and put Santa hats over them.


### To run

First, get OpenCV2.
Then, run 

`python facialDetectionAndOverlay.py`



### Where to get stuff
The classifier `haar_frontalface.xml` can be found (among with others) on OpenCV's repo: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades.
More icons (look for PNG) can be found on https://findicons.com
